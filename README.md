### I have used these similar api.
export const API_HOST = 'community-open-weather-map.p.rapidapi.com';
export const API_KEY = '64a5bc31efmsh3db7538db0bafd5p1575b6jsn1f62d23b4554';
export const BASE_PATH = 'https://community-open-weather-map.p.rapidapi.com';

I used  Material UI, redux, redux-saga,react.
this API_KEY key has reestriction for 100 triggers after that api gets failed.
I used the community-open weather.map beacuase the provided api expample was not working as expected.
